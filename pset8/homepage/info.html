            <h3>Hello!</h3>
            <p>My name is Ronald Calderon, and I started taking the CS50 course as part of the '100 days of code' challenge.</p>
            <p>I've had some experience with programming in the past:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visual Basic 6.0, as part of a programming class several years ago.</li>
                <li>PASCAL, as part of the introductory course to programming and computer science.</li>
                <li>C, as the follow-up to PASCAL.</li>
                <li>Python, which I started learning on my own.</li>
                <li>JavaScript, which I started learning on my own as well.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Nowadays, I prefer to do things in Python and JavaScript, while still learning more about the languages, be it frameworks or libraries.</p>
            <p>I've also had a bit of interest in machine learning and neural networks, inspired by SethBling's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44" target="_blank">MarI/O</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipi40cb_RsI" target="_blank">MariFlow</a> neural networks, and Cary Huang's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh/videos" target="_blank">videos</a>.</p>
